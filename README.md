# Fibonacci Sequence Generator ðŸ”¢

This project is a Fibonacci sequence generator that offers two modes for generating numbers: by specifying the count of numbers to generate or by setting an approximate maximum value. It also provides flexibility in displaying the output either as a list or vertically. The tool is useful for learning, testing, or demonstrating how Fibonacci sequences work.

## Features

- **Two Generation Modes**:
  - **By Count**: Generate a specified number of Fibonacci numbers.
  - **By Maximum Value**: Generate Fibonacci numbers up to an approximate maximum value.
- **Custom Output Format**:
  - **List Format**: Display all generated numbers in a single list.
  - **Vertical Format**: Display each number on a new line.
- **Interactive User Input**: Allows users to choose the generation mode and output format through console prompts.
- **Efficient Calculation**: Utilizes a simple iterative approach to compute Fibonacci numbers.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures that user inputs are valid numbers.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kinglord1090/fibonacci-sequence-generator.git
    ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd fibonacci-sequence-generator
    ```
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python fib-gen.py
    ```
3. Follow the prompts:
   - Choose the generation mode:
     - Type `1` to enter the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.
     - Type `2` to enter an approximate maximum value for the sequence.
   - Choose the output format:
     - Type `1` to get the sequence as a list.
     - Type `2` to display each number vertically.

4. The program will generate the Fibonacci sequence based on your inputs.
